# My Story  
  
My data journey formally began back in 2018 when I joined Forrester as a Research Associate on the Business Insights team. Within my first few weeks, I learned of an incident where an [autonomous vehicle killed a pedestrian](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/technology/uber-driverless-fatality.html) (we would go on to cite this case in subsequent research on responsbile AI). This moment crystallized for me that AI is much more than conversational chatbots or automating processes; AI development without ethical oversight and considerations for human well-being has very real - sometimes even fatal - consequences. In addition to responsible AI, I've also developed interests in data culture and literacy, LLMs and generative models, and decision science.  
  
Over the next seven years, I continued to build my career and nurture my passion for data as a consultant and researcher analyzing trends in the enterprise data and AI space and providing strategic guidance to data leaders. While I found fulfillment in helping my clients solve their problems, in time I came to realize an unfulfilled desire: to contribute more directly to building and deploying solutions that impact people. Recognizing that I lacked the technical depth needed to pursue my goal, I enrolled in Georgia Tech's Analytics MS program to cultivate and fortify my data science skillset. Soon, I hope to explore opportunities as a data practitioner in areas like urban planning, community development, healthcare, or sustainability - domains where human-centered data solutions can create meaningful social impact.  
  
Outside of work and school, I love exploring new hobbies and spending time with friends, family, and my three lovely cats (Ahri, Poppy, and Rumble). You'll probably find me knitting (or some other niche craft), at the local rock climbing gym, tackling the NYT puzzles (especially the crossword), on a wilderness excursion, or cooking and eating good food (in equal parts).
